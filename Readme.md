Planio Greasmonkey/Chrome User Script
=====================================

Features
--------

* Adds a tab for time tracking
* Modifies the project list drop down: When you choose a different project in the project list drop down on the time tracking reports page you will not be redirected to the tasks list but instead see the same report for the selected project.
* Formats the project overview site a bit nicer for administrators.

Install Notes
-------------
First download planio.user.js.
Then 
* on Firefox install Greasemonkey, create a new script an copy/paste the contents of planio.user.js.
* on chrome just drag'n'drop the file onto the browser.

What about Redmine, Chiliproject, etc.?
---------------------------------------

It probably works in any redmine installation and theme. I only tested it on http://plan.io . Patches welcome.
